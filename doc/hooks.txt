Random thoughts about the hooks
-------------------------------

Nodes connect to the API once every X time. In a way we want to check if problems arise and
push a message to someone to investigate, instead of being dependent on website watching monkeys
and hope they pass the message through.

I started with an initial Slack webhook implementation, because we use Slack in our auroracoin
dev team. The idea is that when a problem arises the API sends a message through the webhook
to a dedicated seed node owner channel in slack.

An other idea is to send an email.

One thing we don't want is the hook spamming the channels/email boxes 5 times a minute, so we 
need some sort of timeout function.
